### üß© Tools and Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel (.xlsm)**  
- **Power Query** for data transformation  
- **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)** for automation  
- **Pivot Tables and Charts** for visualization

### üß† How It Works
1. Data is imported from `documents.csv` and `workflows.csv` through Power Query.  
2. Power Query cleans and transforms the data:
   - Calculates new columns like `CycleDays` and `StepDurationHours`.  
   - Normalizes workflow and document status fields.  
3. The Dashboard sheet calculates and displays all KPIs.  
4. A VBA macro refreshes data, updates the visuals, and exports the Dashboard as a PDF report.
